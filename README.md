:eggplant: Scripts that simplify access and management of IST's sigma cluster

1. sigma is pretty straightforward, it just establishes an ssh session with sigma.ist.utl.pt
2. stsigma stands for **Send to Sigma** and it simplifies sending files to sigma's /web/ folder. 
    usage: stsigma [username] [filename]
